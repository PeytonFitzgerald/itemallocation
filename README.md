$ python3 shopping.py -inputfile shopping.txt
1. Make sure that the data to be sorted is titled shopping.txt, and is in the same directory as the shopping.py
   Data in the file should be organized such that the first line indicates how many test cases there are and the second line indicates
   how many items in the shopping list there are (followed by that many items P and then W, e.g., 26 17 for a price of
   26 and a weight of 17.) Next should be a digit indicating how many family members there are, followed by separate lines
   indicating each of those family members weight capacity. This should be repeated for each test case. 
   For example:
   1
   3
   72 17
   44 23
   31 24
   1
   26
2. Run shopping.py (e.g., "python shopping.py" within the terminal)
3. Check the shopping.out file to view the sorted data that was provided in data.txt.
